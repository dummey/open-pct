# Introduction

Hiking the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) is an amazing experience. And if you are reading this, then you are probably tempted by the beauty and adventure that the PCT has to offer. This book is written for you.

One thing you may notice is that this book uses GitBook. The idea behind this technology is that this book belong to everybody and is only as good as the work that everybody puts into it. While I (Data, 2016) may have started the first words, it will be you, the readers, who will make it a useful resource.
