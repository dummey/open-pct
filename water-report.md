# Water Report
  The PCT goes through several sections that are extremely dry. Without the water report, it would be nearly impossible to navigate the desert. 
  
  This is where the [Pacific Crest Trail Water Report](https://pctwater.com/) comes to save all our butts. It's maintained by some volunteers. And kept up to date by people on the trail sending emails/text in with updates on water sources along the trail.
  
### Sections Covered
####Campo, CA to Cottenwood Pass
  This section is mostly desert and thus dry. The largest water carry is in this section. 


### Using on the Trail
#### PDF
#### Google Docs

### Contributing
  
The [water report](https://pctwater.com/) and availability of water in general needs to be mentioned early because it is a limiting factor.
