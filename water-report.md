# Water Report
  The PCT goes through several sections that are extremely dry. Without the water report, it would be nearly impossible to navigate the desert. 
  This is where the [Pacific Crest Trail Water Report](https://pctwater.com/) comes to save all our butts. It's maintained by some volunteers. And kept up to date by people on the trail sending emails/text in with updates on water sources along the trail.
