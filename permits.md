# Permits
For the most up to date information about permits useful for the PCT, visit the [PCTA.org](https://www.pcta.org/discover-the-trail/permits/long-distance-permit-request/)

Generally speaking, there are 3 permits that a hiker would care about:

1. [PCT Long-distance Permit](https://www.pcta.org/discover-the-trail/permits/long-distance-permit-request/)
2. [Application for Entry into Canada Permit](http://www.pcta.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/PCT-Canada-Entry-Form-10-26-15.pdf?965530)
3. [California Campfire Permits](http://www.preventwildfireca.org/Campfire-Permit/)

The **time critical** one is the PCT Long-distance Permit as there is a quota system (50 permits per day in 2016) in place. It fills up fast, so check to see when the permits open up and set a reminder! 

### Controversy
There are some arguments about whether the PCT permit is required or not. In theory it is possible to avoid all sections that require a permit to camp in, such as Yosemite.
